  Basics
  ======
    
    xui is available as the global `x$` function. It accepts a CSS selector string or DOM element, or an array of a mix of these, as parameters,
    and returns the xui object. For example:
    
        var header = x$('#header'); // returns the element with id attribute equal to "header".
        
    For more information on CSS selectors, see the [W3C specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html). Please note that there are
    different levels of CSS selector support (Levels 1, 2 and 3) and different browsers support each to different degrees. Be warned!
    
  The functions described in the docs are available on the xui object and often manipulate or retrieve information about the elements in the
  xui collection.

  extend
  ------

  Extends XUI's prototype with the members of another object.

  ### syntax ###

    xui.extend( object );

  ### arguments ###

  - object `Object` contains the members that will be added to XUI's prototype.
 
  ### example ###

  Given:

    var sugar = {
        first: function() { return this[0]; },
        last:  function() { return this[this.length - 1]; }
    }

  We can extend xui's prototype with members of `sugar` by using `extend`:

/**
  find
  ----

  Find the elements that match a query string. `x$` is an alias for `find`.

  ### syntax ###

    x$( window ).find( selector, context );

  ### arguments ###

  - selector `String` is a CSS selector that will query for elements.
  - context `HTMLElement` is the parent element to search from _(optional)_.
 
  ### example ###

  Given the following markup:

    <ul id="first">

    </ul>
    <ul id="second">
        <li id="three">3</li>
        <li id="four">4</li>
    </ul>

  We can select list items using `find`:

    x$('li');                 // returns all four list item elements.
    x$('#second').find('li'); // returns list items "three" and "four"

  Given:

    <div>
        <div class="round">Item one</div>

/**
  Tween
  -----

  Transforms a CSS property's value.

  ### syntax ###

    x$( selector ).tween( properties, callback );

  ### arguments ###

      - `Object` is a JSON object that defines the CSS properties.
      - `Array` is a `Object` set that is tweened sequentially.
  - callback `Function` to be called when the animation is complete. _(optional)_.

  ### properties ###

  A property can be any CSS style, referenced by the JavaScript notation.

  A property can also be an option from [emile.js](https://github.com/madrobby/emile):

  - duration `Number` of the animation in milliseconds.
  - after `Function` is called after the animation is finished.
  - easing `Function` allows for the overriding of the built-in animation function.

      // Receives one argument `pos` that indicates position
      // in time between animation's start and end.
      function(pos) {
          // return the new position
          return (-Math.cos(pos * Math.PI) / 2) + 0.5;

/**
  xhr
  ---

  The classic `XMLHttpRequest` sometimes also known as the Greek hero: _Ajax_. Not to be confused with _AJAX_ the cleaning agent.

  ### detail ###

  This method has a few new tricks.

  It is always invoked on an element collection and uses the behaviour of `html`.

  If there is no callback, then the `responseText` will be inserted into the elements in the collection.

  ### syntax ###

    x$( selector ).xhr( location, url, options )

  or accept a url with a default behavior of inner:

    x$( selector ).xhr( url, options );

  or accept a url with a callback:
  
    x$( selector ).xhr( url, fn );

  ### arguments ###

  - location `String` is the location to insert the `responseText`. See `html` for values.
  - url `String` is where to send the request.
  - fn `Function` is called on status 200 (i.e. success callback).
  - options `Object` is a JSON object with one or more of the following:
    - method `String` can be _get_, _put_, _delete_, _post_. Default is _get_.
    - async `Boolean` enables an asynchronous request. Defaults to _false_.
    - data `String` is a url encoded string of parameters to send.
                - error `Function` is called on error or status that is not 200. (i.e. failure callback).
    - callback `Function` is called on status 200 (i.e. success callback).
    - headers `Object` is a JSON object with key:value pairs that get set in the request's header set.

  ### response ###

  - The response is available to the callback function as `this`.
  - The response is not passed into the callback.
  - `this.reponseText` will have the resulting data from the file.

  ### example ###

    x$('#status').xhr('inner', '/status.html');
    x$('#status').xhr('outer', '/status.html');
    x$('#status').xhr('top',   '/status.html');
    x$('#status').xhr('bottom','/status.html');
    x$('#status').xhr('before','/status.html');
    x$('#status').xhr('after', '/status.html');

// 
// About: Support and Testing
// 
// Information about what version or versions of jQuery this plugin has been
// tested with, what browsers it has been tested in, and where the unit tests
// reside (so you can test it yourself).
// 
// jQuery Versions - 1.2.6, 1.3.2, 1.4.1, 1.4.2
// Browsers Tested - Internet Explorer 6-8, Firefox 2-4, Chrome 5-6, Safari 3.2-5,
//                   Opera 9.6-10.60, iPhone 3.1, Android 1.6-2.2, BlackBerry 4.6-5.
// Unit Tests      - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-hashchange/unit/
// 
// About: Known issues
// 
// While this jQuery hashchange event implementation is quite stable and
// robust, there are a few unfortunate browser bugs surrounding expected
// hashchange event-based behaviors, independent of any JavaScript
// window.onhashchange abstraction. See the following examples for more
// information:
// 
// Chrome: Back Button - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-hashchange/examples/bug-chrome-back-button/
// Firefox: Remote XMLHttpRequest - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-hashchange/examples/bug-firefox-remote-xhr/
// WebKit: Back Button in an Iframe - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-hashchange/examples/bug-webkit-hash-iframe/
// Safari: Back Button from a different domain - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-hashchange/examples/bug-safari-back-from-diff-domain/
// 
// Also note that should a browser natively support the window.onhashchange 
// event, but not report that it does, the fallback polling loop will be used.
// 
// About: Release History
// 
// 1.3   - (7/21/2010) Reorganized IE6/7 Iframe code to make it more
//         "removable" for mobile-only development. Added IE6/7 document.title
//         support. Attempted to make Iframe as hidden as possible by using
//         techniques from http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/?p=604. Added 
//         support for the "shortcut" format $(window).hashchange( fn ) and
//         $(window).hashchange() like jQuery provides for built-in events.
//         Renamed jQuery.hashchangeDelay to <jQuery.fn.hashchange.delay> and
//         lowered its default value to 50. Added <jQuery.fn.hashchange.domain>
//         and <jQuery.fn.hashchange.src> properties plus document-domain.html
//         file to address access denied issues when setting document.domain in
//         IE6/7.
// 1.2   - (2/11/2010) Fixed a bug where coming back to a page using this plugin
//         from a page on another domain would cause an error in Safari 4. Also,
//         IE6/7 Iframe is now inserted after the body (this actually works),
//         which prevents the page from scrolling when the event is first bound.
//         Event can also now be bound before DOM ready, but it won't be usable
//         before then in IE6/7.
// 1.1   - (1/21/2010) Incorporated document.documentMode test to fix IE8 bug
//         where browser version is incorrectly reported as 8.0, despite
//         inclusion of the X-UA-Compatible IE=EmulateIE7 meta tag.
// 1.0   - (1/9/2010) Initial Release. Broke out the jQuery BBQ event.special
//         window.onhashchange functionality into a separate plugin for users
//         who want just the basic event & back button support, without all the
//         extra awesomeness that BBQ provides. This plugin will be included as
//         part of jQuery BBQ, but also be available separately.

  // Bind a handler to the window.onhashchange event or trigger all bound

  // 
  // Usage:
  // 
  // > jQuery(window).hashchange( [ handler ] );
  // 
  // Arguments:
  // 
  //  handler - (Function) Optional handler to be bound to the hashchange
  //    event. This is a "shortcut" for the more verbose form:
  //    jQuery(window).bind( 'hashchange', handler ). If handler is omitted,
  //    all bound window.onhashchange event handlers will be triggered. This
  //    is a shortcut for the more verbose
  //    jQuery(window).trigger( 'hashchange' ). These forms are described in
  //    the <hashchange event> section.
  // 
  // Returns:
  // 
  //  (jQuery) The initial jQuery collection of elements.
  
  // Allow the "shortcut" format $(elem).hashchange( fn ) for binding and
  // $(elem).hashchange() for triggering, like jQuery does for built-in events.

  // 
  // The numeric interval (in milliseconds) at which the <hashchange event>
  // polling loop executes. Defaults to 50.
  
  // Property: jQuery.fn.hashchange.domain
  // 
  // If you're setting document.domain in your JavaScript, and you want hash
  // history to work in IE6/7, not only must this property be set, but you must
  // also set document.domain BEFORE jQuery is loaded into the page. This
  // property is only applicable if you are supporting IE6/7 (or IE8 operating
  // in "IE7 compatibility" mode).
  // 
  // In addition, the <jQuery.fn.hashchange.src> property must be set to the
  // path of the included "document-domain.html" file, which can be renamed or
  // modified if necessary (note that the document.domain specified must be the
  // same in both your main JavaScript as well as in this file).
  // 
  // Usage:
  // 
  // jQuery.fn.hashchange.domain = document.domain;
  
  // Property: jQuery.fn.hashchange.src
  // 
  // If, for some reason, you need to specify an Iframe src file (for example,
  // when setting document.domain as in <jQuery.fn.hashchange.domain>), you can
  // do so using this property. Note that when using this property, history
  // won't be recorded in IE6/7 until the Iframe src file loads. This property
  // is only applicable if you are supporting IE6/7 (or IE8 operating in "IE7
  // compatibility" mode).
  // 
  // Usage:
  // 
  // jQuery.fn.hashchange.src = 'path/to/file.html';

  // Event: hashchange event
  // 
  // Fired when location.hash changes. In browsers that support it, the native
  // HTML5 window.onhashchange event is used, otherwise a polling loop is
  // initialized, running every <jQuery.fn.hashchange.delay> milliseconds to
  // see if the hash has changed. In IE6/7 (and IE8 operating in "IE7
  // compatibility" mode), a hidden Iframe is created to allow the back button
  // and hash-based history to work.
  // 
  // Usage as described in <jQuery.fn.hashchange>:
  // 
  // > // Bind an event handler.
  // > jQuery(window).hashchange( function(e) {
  // >   var hash = location.hash;
  // >   ...
  // > });
  // > 
  // > // Manually trigger the event handler.
  // > jQuery(window).hashchange();
  // 
  // A more verbose usage that allows for event namespacing:
  // 
  // > // Bind an event handler.
  // > jQuery(window).bind( 'hashchange', function(e) {
  // >   var hash = location.hash;
  // >   ...
  // > });
  // > 
  // > // Manually trigger the event handler.
  // > jQuery(window).trigger( 'hashchange' );
  // 
  // Additional Notes:
  // 
  // * The polling loop and Iframe are not created until at least one handler
  //   is actually bound to the 'hashchange' event.
  // * If you need the bound handler(s) to execute immediately, in cases where
  //   a location.hash exists on page load, via bookmark or page refresh for
  //   example, use jQuery(window).hashchange() or the more verbose 
  //   jQuery(window).trigger( 'hashchange' ).
  // * The event can be bound before DOM ready, but since it won't be usable
  //   before then in IE6/7 (due to the necessary Iframe), recommended usage is
  //   to bind it inside a DOM ready handler.

			// Because the target of the touch event that triggered the vclick
			// can be different from the target of the click event synthesized

			// from a touch event seems to be implementation specific. For example,
			// some browsers will fire mouse/click events for a link that is near
			// a touch event, even though the target of the touchstart/touchend event
			// says the user touched outside the link. Also, it seems that with most
			// browsers, the target of the mouse/click event is not calculated until the
			// time it is dispatched, so if you replace an element that you touched
			// with another element, the target of the mouse/click will be the new
			// element underneath that point.
			//
			// Aside from proximity, we also check to see if the target and any
			// of its ancestors were the ones that blocked a click. This is necessary
			// because of the strange mouse/click target calculation done in the
			// Android 2.1 browser, where if you click on an element, and there is a
			// mouse/click handler on one of its ancestors, the target will be the
			// innermost child of the touched element, even if that child is no where
